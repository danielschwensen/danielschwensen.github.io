Iâ€™m Daniel

I created this blog mainly for the purpose of documenting my day-to-day work. Often I find myself referring back to old posts on troubleshooting issues or previous implementations to help me resolve current problems or tasks.

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now.
