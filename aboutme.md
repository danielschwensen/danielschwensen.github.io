Iâ€™m Daniel.

I created this blog as a way to document the various IT-related things I spend my time on.

I am an IT professional who likes exploring new technologies, learning new skills, or working on projects, I find great fulfillment in staying up-to-date and constantly learning in the field of IT. 

Recently, I have been focusing on AWS, delving into its many offerings. I have also recently earned the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate certification and  I am eager to continue expanding my skills in cloud computing by obtaining additional AWS certifications. I am excited to see where the journey takes me.

Thank you for stopping by. If you have any questions or comments, don't hesitate to reach out.
