If you're like me, you've often forgotten to back up your WinSCP settings. Not anymore! Today, I've finally taken the plunge and added a simple solution to my backup script. It's a quick and painless way to ensure you never lose your settings again.


{% highlight Powershell %}
$BackupPath = "YourDestination"
$WinScpExportRegKey = "HKCU\Software\Martin Prikryl"
$WinScpstrExportFileName = "WinScpSettings_$(get-date -f yyyyMMddhhmmss).reg"
$WinScpExportPath = "$env:Temp\ $WinScpstrExportFileName"
Reg export $WinScpExportRegKey $WinScpExportPath
Copy-Item -Path $WinScpExportPath "$BackupPath\WinSCP"
{% endhighlight %}

And just like that, you've backed up your WinSCP settings! It's one of those things we always say we'll do but never get around to. Well, today was the day for me.
