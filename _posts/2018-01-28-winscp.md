If you're like me, you've often forgotten to back up your WinSCP settings. Not anymore! Today, I've finally taken the plunge and added a simple solution to my backup script. It's a quick and painless way to ensure you never lose your settings again.

{% highlight Powershell %}
<#
.SYNOPSIS
This script backs up WinSCP settings by exporting the relevant registry key.

.DESCRIPTION
Exports the WinSCP registry key and saves it with a timestamp to a specified backup location.

.PARAMETER BackupPath
The path where the backup should be saved.

.EXAMPLE
.\Backup-WinSCP.ps1 -BackupPath "C:\Backups"
#>

[CmdletBinding()]
param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)]
    [string]$BackupPath = 'C:\YourBackupFolder'
)

function Export-WinSCPSettings {
    # Define the WinSCP registry key and backup file name
    $WinScpExportRegKey = "HKCU\Software\Martin Prikryl"
    $WinScpstrExportFileName = "WinScpSettings_$(get-date -f yyyyMMddHHmmss).reg"
    $WinScpExportPath = Join-Path -Path $env:Temp -ChildPath $WinScpstrExportFileName

    # Export the registry key
    & reg.exe export $WinScpExportRegKey $WinScpExportPath

    # Copy the exported file to the backup destination
    Copy-Item -Path $WinScpExportPath -Destination $BackupPath

    # Clean up the temporary exported file
    Remove-Item -Path $WinScpExportPath
}

Export-WinSCPSettings
{% endhighlight %}

And just like that, you've backed up your WinSCP settings! It's one of those things we always say we'll do but never get around to. Well, today was the day for me.
