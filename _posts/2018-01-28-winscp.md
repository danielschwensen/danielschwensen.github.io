I always forget to backup my WinSCP setting but today I set up a task added the following simple entry to my backup script:
```
$BackupPath = "YourDestination"
$WinScpExportRegKey = "HKCU\Software\Martin Prikryl"
$WinScpstrExportFileName = "WinScpSettings_$(get-date -f yyyyMMddhhmmss).reg"
$WinScpExportPath = "$env:Temp\ $WinScpstrExportFileName"
Reg export $WinScpExportRegKey $WinScpExportPath
Copy-Item -Path $WinScpExportPath "$BackupPath\WinSCP"
```
Ta-da! Should have - as always -done it before :-)
