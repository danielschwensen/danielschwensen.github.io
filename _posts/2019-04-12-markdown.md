# Blockquotes

To create a block quote, all you have to do is preface a line with the "greater than" caret (>).
You can also place a caret character on each line of the quote. This is particularly useful if your quote spans multiple paragraphs.

>block quote

# Lists

To create an unordered list, you'll want to preface each item in the list with an asterisk ( * ). Each list item also gets its own line. For example, a grocery list in Markdown might look like this:
* Milk
* Eggs
* Salmon
* Butter

````
* Milk
* Eggs
* Salmon
* Butter
````

Occasionally, you might find the need to make a list with more depth, or, to nest one list within another. Have no fear, because the Markdown syntax is exactly the same. All you have to do is to remember to indent each asterisk one space more than the preceding item.
For example, in the following list, we're going to add some sub-lists to each "main" list item, describing the people in detail:

 * Tintin
   * A reporter
   * Has poofy orange hair
   * Friends with the world's most awesome dog
* Haddock
  * A sea captain
    * Has a fantastic beard
    * Loves whiskey

# Escaping

Backslash (\\) escapes the following characters:\
\  `  *  _  {  }  [  ]  (  )  #  +  -  .  !

\\*this text is surrounded by literal asterisks\*\
